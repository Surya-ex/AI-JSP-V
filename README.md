# AI-Powered Job Recommendation System for Ex-Servicemen  

Helping heroes transition from military to civilian careers with the power of AI.  

---

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This project aims to build an AI-powered platform that assists **ex-servicemen** in finding suitable civilian jobs. Military resumes often contain terms and roles that don’t directly map to the corporate world. Our system bridges this gap by:  
- Parsing resumes with **NLP**  
- Translating military roles into **civilian skills**  
- Matching candidates with relevant **job postings**  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (main language)  
- **Pandas / NumPy** (data preprocessing)  
- **NLTK / spaCy** (resume parsing, NLP)  
- **Transformers (BERT/CareerBERT)** (semantic embeddings)  
- **Scikit-learn / PyTorch** (model training & evaluation)  
- **Faiss** (efficient similarity search)
